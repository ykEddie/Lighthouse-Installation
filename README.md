# Step-by-Step

## Installing Lighthouse through the CLI

Lighthouse is used to improve the quality of a website by running performace tests and then allowing you to configure whatever is needed to make it run better.

### Navigate to your command line or your PC/laptop
Once you have opened it navigate to where you want to install Lighthouse

### To install it

```
 npm install -g lighthouse

```

### To run an audit

```
 lighthouse <url>
 
```
This will result in another window being opened to the website you're auditing and the results being displayed on the command line.
